- After a disaster or a calamity strikes a place its destruction is very vast. The affected area and people need sufficient backup and supplies for further proceedings and recovery from the damage. Our project is a platform for the helpers and the rescue team to connect with the people who are affected. This makes the supplies reach the people as soon as possible and makes the recovery in a very soon manner.
- This project is very useful in the aspects of saving time and recovering quickly. There are many connectivity and reachability issues while speaking about the disasters. This is a very effective method of gaining information about the requirements and problems in the  first place. Both the victims and the helpers could know in detail about the damage and the requiremants through the data given. This  would be a very effective method.
- People should just install an app and register them already or after the damage. The victims should enter their problems and requirements for their recovery in the app, which would be updated every few minutes. These information are checked for reliability and are brought to the concern of the helpers and the rescue team and they act further.
- This is also a social concerned problem, so people should cooperate on the either sides of the system. The helpers are social activitists and environmenalists who help the people effectively on any circumstances.
- This program is maintained and contributed by myself K.A.KAUSHIK RAM.
